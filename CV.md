Currently
--------------------
I'm studying at the intersection of Cell and Molecular Biology and Statistics at the [University of Arkansas](http://www.uark.edu/). I'm currently developing quantitative techniques and an integrative workflow for quantifying virulence of host-virus interactions across domains of life. My work involves a synergy of techniques including agent and constraint based modeling of infection, Bayesian (Gaussian Process Regression) and Machine Learning techniques to quantify, classify, and predict effects of virus-host interactions.


Employment
--------------------

__Since 2020__
:   *Graduate Research Assistant for the [Ceballos Research Lab](https://ceballoslab.uark.edu/)*
    (Fayetteville, AR. United States).
* Researching novel approaches for quantifying host-virus interactions of non-lytic viruses. 

* I analyze virus-induced temporal phenotypic changes of the host to quantify virulence. 

* Co-authored two papers introducing and applying techniques for differentiation virus-induced growth changes. 

* Gaussian process modeling techniques, MLP Classifiers, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, dynamic flux-balance analysis of stressed systems and agent-based simulation techniques

__2019-2020__
:   *Laboratory Technician for the [Ceballos Research Lab](https://ceballoslab.uark.edu/)*
    (Fayetteville, AR. United States).

* Operated state-of-the-art Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) machine 

* Created a SOP for use and maintenance of device including automated buffer making, ion exchange, and size exclusion best-practices. 

* Maintained lab supplies and handled ordering for the lab. I implemented a proof-of-concept neuron tracing and counting algorithm to be used by a PhD student. 

* Used the software Geneious for primer design, phylogenetic analysis of novel genomes to assist graduate and undergraduate research projects in the lab. 

* Used protein databank tools and molecular dynamics protein modeling tools to predict sub-unit interactions of engineered protein complex.

__2019 (6 months)__
:   *Athletic Tutor for University of Arkansas Athletics Program*
    (Fayetteville, AR. United States).
    
* Lead individual and small group tutoring sessions for General and Organic Chemistry I and II, Biochemistry I, Biochemistry II, Introduction to Biochemistry, Principles of Biology,  Anatomy and Physiology, Calculus I, and Principles of Statistics.


__2017-2019__
:   *Peace Corps Volunteer High School Chemistry Teacher*
    (Kolahun, Lofa County. Liberia).

* Worked as first and only chemistry teacher in only high school in Kolahun district of Liberia since 2004. Designed and led interactive lesson plans for over 1200 students for 2 years (grades 10-12). 

* Created exam questions for each grade and compiled a question generator for future use.

* Engaged in capacity building by training other interested science teachers in fundamental chemistry concepts and ways to teach them. 

* Provided resources and practice teaching chemistry courses to student teacher in order to continue after my departure. 

* Co-lead Girls Club of Kolahun in promotion of gender equity. Introduced indigenous language component to malaria education program at local health clinic. 

* Grassroots soccer volunteer and mentor. 

* Collaborated with local NGO to train local students to lead age-appropriate critical thinking workshops for children identified as disadvantaged.

__2014-2017__
:   *Supplemental Instruction Leader (Chemistry) for CLASS+ at University of Arkansas* 
    (Fayetteville, AR. United States).

* Lead small group drill sessions to promote student success in first year chemistry courses ranging from Fundamentals of Chemistry to Honors Chemistry II. 

* Designed and facilitated interactive lesson plans. 

* Served as an SI leader mentor advising and co-leading yearly trainings for SI leaders on campus. 

* Focused on increasing interactivity in lessons and promoting gender equitable teaching approaches.

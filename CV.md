## Currently

I am a graduate student in Cell and Molecular Biology and Statistics at
the [University of Arkansas](http://www.uark.edu/). I'm currently
developing bioinformatic pipelines for CRISPR forward genetic screen
studies of the stress response in wild strains of yeast. My work
involves bioinformatic pipeline construction and operation, bulk RNA-seq
analysis, and statistical analyses for advanced forward genetic screen
experimental designs.

## Employment

**Since 2021**

:   *Graduate Research Assistant for [The Lewis
    Lab](https://thelewislab.com/)* (Fayetteville, AR. United States).

-   Currently implementing an nf-core compatible MAGeCK analysis
    pipeline tailored to CRISPR-based forward genetic screens for
    understanding stress in yeast.

-   Analyzed RNA-seq data from over 100 samples in a non-model organism
    with Nextflow bioinformatic workflow manager.

-   Improved GO annotations to facilitate enrichment analysis of above
    data via functional annotation mapping.

-   Constructed GFP-RFP mutant reporter construction and validation.

-   Validation of stress-responsive induction of reporters via operation
    of benchtop flow cytometer and subsequent custom analysis and
    visualizaiton pipeline.

-   Excellence in teaching: Mean course evaluation score my students
    provide for Principles of Biology labs: 4.8/5

**2019-2020**

:   *Laboratory Technician for the [Ceballos Research
    Lab](https://ceballoslab.uark.edu/)* (Fayetteville, AR. United
    States).

-   Researched novel approaches for quantifying host-virus interactions
    of non-lytic viruses.

-   Analyzed virus-induced temporal phenotypic changes of the host to
    quantify virulence.

-   Co-authored two papers introducing and applying techniques for
    differentiation virus-induced growth changes.

-   Utilized aussian process modeling techniques, MLP Classifiers,
    convolutional and recurrent neural networks, dynamic flux-balance
    analysis of stressed systems and agent-based simulation techniques

-   Operated state-of-the-art Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC)
    machine

-   Created a SOP for use and maintenance of device including automated
    buffer making, ion exchange, and size exclusion best-practices.

-   Maintained lab supplies and handled ordering for the lab. I
    implemented a proof-of-concept neuron tracing and counting algorithm
    to be used by a PhD student.

-   Used the software Geneious for primer design, phylogenetic analysis
    of novel genomes to assist graduate and undergraduate research
    projects in the lab.

-   Used protein databank tools and molecular dynamics protein modeling
    tools to predict sub-unit interactions of engineered protein
    complex.

**2019 (6 months)**

:   *Athletic Tutor for University of Arkansas Athletics Program*
    (Fayetteville, AR. United States).

-   Lead individual and small group tutoring sessions for General and
    Organic Chemistry I and II, Biochemistry I, Biochemistry II,
    Introduction to Biochemistry, Principles of Biology, Anatomy and
    Physiology, Calculus I, and Principles of Statistics.

**2017-2018**

:   *Peace Corps Volunteer High School Chemistry Teacher* (Kolahun, Lofa
    County. Liberia).

-   Worked as first and only chemistry teacher in only high school in
    Kolahun district of Liberia since 2004. Designed and led interactive
    lesson plans for over 1200 students for 2 years (grades 10-12).

-   Created exam questions for each grade and compiled a question
    generator for future use.

-   Engaged in capacity building by training other interested science
    teachers in fundamental chemistry concepts and ways to teach them.

-   Provided resources and practice teaching chemistry courses to
    student teacher in order to continue after my departure.

-   Co-lead Girls Club of Kolahun in promotion of gender equity.
    Introduced indigenous language component to malaria education
    program at local health clinic.

-   Grassroots soccer volunteer and mentor.

-   Collaborated with local NGO to train local students to lead
    age-appropriate critical thinking workshops for children identified
    as disadvantaged.

**2014-2017**

:   *Supplemental Instruction Leader (Chemistry) for CLASS+ at
    University of Arkansas* (Fayetteville, AR. United States).

-   Lead small group drill sessions to promote student success in first
    year chemistry courses ranging from Fundamentals of Chemistry to
    Honors Chemistry II.

-   Designed and facilitated interactive lesson plans.

-   Served as an SI leader mentor advising and co-leading yearly
    trainings for SI leaders on campus.

-   Focused on increasing interactivity in lessons and promoting gender
    equitable teaching approaches.

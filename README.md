This is a repository that I use for this course. My assignments are submitted here. 

The assn03.tgz file is a zipped tape archive containing the bash scripts that I used to create BLAST databases and complete BLAST searches, as well as their outputs and answers to all questions in completion of assignment 3 questions in this course.
